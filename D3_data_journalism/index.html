          <h2>Observations on the Relationship Between Poverty and Obesity</h2>
          <p>It has long been theorized that poverty begets obesity. This assumption derives primarily from two generally
            accepted facts: the most economical meals tend to have poor nutritional value, and those in poverty have less
          access to health care. </p>

          <p>In competitive markets such as food, often the primary methods to increase profitability are to reduce cost and 
            increase quantity supplied. Cutting costs may include using "filler" ingredients, and increasing quantities usually
            involve speeding the growth/production process using chemicals. The common thread is these all sacrifice the taste & 
            nutritional quality of the food, with the primary recipient being the poorest consumers.</p>

          <p>In the American capitalistic environment, individuals are largely left to nagivate the health 
            care system on their own. Those with less means often have low-quality or no plans. In the event of an injury without 
            treatment an individual is more susceptible to developing obesity, and preventative health care is largely absent from these plans.
